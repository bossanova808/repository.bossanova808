The main thing here of potential interest to others is the automatic skin patcher, to support OzWeather skin changes (giving you e.g. animated BOM radars in Kodi in a number of popular skins) - see the [OzWeather Wiki](https://kodi.wiki/index.php?title=Add-on:Oz_Weather) for details.

There is also a script (never formally released, but I've used it for years) - for displaying some simple 'now playing' information (remaining time & current temperature), on an external USB connected [Yocto MaxiDisplay](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-displays/yocto-maxidisplay).

Finally, there is my personal version of Confluence with modifications including integrated OzWeather support, ClearArt support, better Profile support, and a few other visual and usability tweaks to my personal taste.
