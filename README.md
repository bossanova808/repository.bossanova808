_(To install, download the latest [repository zip](https://github.com/bossanova808/repository.bossanova808/tree/42b19fc74f4158414b3d444f1f43904f9c5a2b0d/repository-downloads/repository.bossanova808) and then use 'Install from zip' in the Kodi Addons area)._

The main thing here of potential interest to others is the automatic skin patcher, to support OzWeather skin changes (giving you e.g. animated Australian BOM weather radars in Kodi, in a number of popular skins) - see the [OzWeather Wiki](https://kodi.wiki/index.php?title=Add-on:Oz_Weather) for full details.

There is also a script for displaying some simple 'now playing' information (remaining time & current temperature), on an external USB connected [Yocto MaxiDisplay](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-displays/yocto-maxidisplay).  Unfortunately this can't be released via the official Kodi repository as it includes pre-compiled binaries for driving the Yocto display.

Finally, there is also my personal customised version of Confluence with modifications including integrated OzWeather support, ClearArt support, better Profile support, and a few other visual and usability tweaks to my personal taste.
