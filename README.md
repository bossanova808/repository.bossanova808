The main thing here is the automatic skin patcher to support [OzWeather](https://kodi.wiki/index.php?title=Add-on:Oz_Weather) skin changes (giving you e.g. animated BOM radars in Kodi).

There is also a script for displaying some now playing information on an external usb Yocto MaxiDisplay.

Finally, a personal version of Confluence with some minor mods inc. integrated OzWeather support, clearart support, and a few other tweaks to my taste.
