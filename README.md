The main thing here is the automatic skin patcher to support OzWeather skin changes (giving you e.g. animated BOM radars in Kodi in a number of skins, see [OzWeather Wiki](https://kodi.wiki/index.php?title=Add-on:Oz_Weather) for details).

There is also a script for displaying some 'now playing' information (remaining time & weather), on an external usb [Yocto MaxiDisplay](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-displays/yocto-maxidisplay).

Finally, there is my personal (family & friends) version of Confluence with some minor modifications inc. integrated OzWeather support, clear-art support, and a few other tweaks to my taste.
