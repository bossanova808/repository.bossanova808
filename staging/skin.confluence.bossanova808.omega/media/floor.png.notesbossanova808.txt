The texture floor.png has been removed as in this skin mod it's only used in a very few places (as our background image is dark enough at the bottom not to generally need it).

Removing the texture itself makes for minimal code changes required.

In those few places we still use the visual floor (movie/video/music views), we change the code to point at floor_b808.png (which is just the original file renamed).
