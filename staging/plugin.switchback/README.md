Kodi utility for fast switching between recently played media.

Keeps a list of recently played media (supports Kodi library episodes, movies, and many video addons).

The primary intended use is to make for super easy Switchback between two in progress videos (by binding a remote key to Switchback, see Wiki/Forum thread).

Consider this scenario:
- You are watching 'video A' with your partner.  You are interrupted and your partner needs to tend to the kids/howl at the moon.
- You navigate to 'video B' and watch some of that.
- Your partner comes back.
- You hit your one button 'Switchback' and 'video A' starts playing again, no need for tedious naviagation etc.
- You are interrupted again - the moon is so very bright tonight - hit your 'Switchback' to resume 'video B' immediately, again with one magic button and no tedious navigation.
