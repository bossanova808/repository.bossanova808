XSQUEEZE NEW VERSION CHANGELOG....

[B]What's new in this version:[/B]

V1.1.9
- Static squeezelite builds for Rasp Pi/2 - should solve mp3 playback issues on those platforms with lucl
- OE linux version (i.e. not Pi/Arm) still broken mp3 playback, sorry

V1..1.8
- Bugfix for app browsing in the Chooser (Radios still being looked in to)
- Support for Rasp Pi 2 (not tested - let me know if it breaks!!)
- I am aware of issue on Openelec 5 and MP3s not playing, hope to have a soluton soon - in the meantime, play FLACS ;)

V1.1.7
- Inhibit XBMC shutdown when XSqueeze active

If you need help, post on the forum thread AND [B]PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR FULL XBMC DEBUG LOG FILE![/B]

[B]Now hit exit and re-run XSqueeze - you won't get this message again[/B]
